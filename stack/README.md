STACK

What is a stack?
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of "last in, first out." This means that when an element is added to the stack it is added to the top, and when an element is removed from the stack it is removed from the top.

Defining characteristics
- Usually a singly linked list
- Helper information
    - top (size)
    - maxsize
- Helper functions
    - push
    - pop
    - peek

Common examples?
- Function "call" stack
- Stack of plates

Visual of stack
- bucket
- fading images

Efficiency
- Constant time insertion/removal/lookup
- If linked list, non-consecutive memory

Code Example
- Basic stack
    - push
    - pop
    - peek
